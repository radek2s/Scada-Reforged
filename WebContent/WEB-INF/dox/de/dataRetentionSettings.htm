    Use the "purge events" settings to set the maximum age of an event before it is purged from the database. Purging
    permanently deletes the event as well as any user comments associated with it.

<p>
    Use the "purge report instances" settings to set the maximum age of a report instance before it is purged from the
    database. Purging permanently deletes the report instance. It is best to set this value as low as possible since
    reports can potentially consume a great deal of available storage space. Purging can be prevented by setting the
    "prevent purge" attribute on the report instance.

<p>
    Click the <b>Purge all data</b> button to permanently delete all point samples currently in the database. This can be
    useful for giving a Mango instance a "fresh start", especially if spurious data exists from configuration and set up
    activities.
</p>

<p>
    Use the "Discard point values future dated" settings to set the maximum amount of time into the future for which
    data points will accept new values. Any values with timestamps that exceed this value will be discarded, and an error
    message will be written to the log.
</p>

<p>
    Option <b>Default values limit for purge</b> is related to property that can be set inside Point properties in Logging properties.
    It indicates how many values will be left in database after purging data when purge strategy with <b>Values limit</b> is selected for a given datapoint.
    This default value is used during datapoint creation.
