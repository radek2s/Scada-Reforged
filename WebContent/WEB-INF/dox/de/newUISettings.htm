<p>The <b>SMS Domain</b> allows you to set SMS-Gateway server address required when user wants to use event handler of type SMS.</p>

<p>The <b>AmCharts Settings</b> contains settings related to AmCharts. Aggregation settings allows user to
    increase the performance of the AmCharts. <b>Enable aggregation</b> allows user to use this setting. User can define the data
    count limit using <b>Values limit</b> parameter. This settings in ideal situation describe the amount of values
    that are distributed evenly on a timeline. But in real life some values are generated at the same time or the gap
    between them can vary so the "ideal" situation with evenly distributed vales is almost impossible. So to fix that
    there is a <b>Limit factor</b> parameter that helps to achieve the more reliable chart. Increasing that factor, we
    divide the interval into smaller blocks, so the data presentation is more accurate. There are more of this
    aggregated
    groups, but in each there are fewer values and averages to calculate. If from specific range there are less values
    than <b>Values limit</b> that mechanism will be disabled. It tries to get the most accurate graph. AmChart
    works well with less than 30 000 of data point values on a single chart, so try to set up your graph to not exceed
    that constraint.</p>

<p>The <b>Default Data Point logging type</b> allows user to set default logging type of newly created data points.</p>
